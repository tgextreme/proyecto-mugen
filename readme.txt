-----------------------------
Install Notes
------------------------------
-Place the folder /data/ inside your MUGEN 1.1 folder.
-Note that it will overwrite your mugen.cfg
-Please make sure your computer supports OpenGL
-This Screenpack is heavy on animation frames, moreso then MUGEN Megamix was, so if your rig had trouble running that, you're in for a shit time.
-Happy (?) April Fool everybody.

==What is this?
This is a screenpack made for MUGEN 1.1. It's a deliberately unfinished April Fools joke I made to advertise my actual next project "Street Fighter Remix Turbo".
Every year for the past 3 or so years I've tried to finish this screenpack for April 1 but each time I fail. I mainly fail because I've moved on from the project and things like the animation style and my old Group Order Framework mean nothing to me now.
==Why "Black Edition"?
"Black Edition" CPUs from AMD are CPUs with unlocked multipliers, allowing your CPU to be overclocked easily, for instance my old ass Phenom II 955 is OC'ed from 3.2ghz to 3.9ghz. Basically what I'm saying is that this screenpack is supercharged as fuck.
==YOU STARTED THIS IN 2015 WTF? YOU SAID YOU'D RELEASE THIS IN 2015? WTF!
I say lots of things.
==How did you make this?
I can't remember, but it probably wasn't optimal.
==Why MUGEN 1.1?
Because fuck WinMugen, and DP DosMugen
==Will you po-
No.
==How about more character sl-
No.
==Less character sl-
No. You're free to make any modifications. PM me on mugenguild if you'd like psds or something.
==Can I use code/graphics?
Go ahead. There's nothing really groundbreaking in these files. Let me know if you intend to distribute anything, just so I can check it out. You can credit me if you like, or not. It'd be nice if you did, though.
==Can I make a video of your work?
Please go ahead. Here's a link to my youtube page if you want to link to it: https://www.youtube.com/c/DevonMUGEN
Here's a page to my MugenGuild profile if you want to link to that:

==Are you willing to collaborate?
Probably not. I'm not much of a team player.

ADVERTISE MY PROJECT: http://network.mugenguild.com/devon/sfrt.html

THANKS
======
I actually have no idea who to credit, uhm. Thank you to Mugenguild for hosting my site.

ON A SERIOUS NOTE
=================
It's quite easy to finish this screenpack for real, I've isolated the code that needs to be deleted, give it a go.
